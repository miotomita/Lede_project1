                    The Blue-footed booby, a marine bird known for its distinctive blue feet and 
                    cartoonish appearance, is one of the most popular species among birdwatchers. 
                    While attracting tourists from around the world to its habitat areas, small 
                    Islands in Eastern Pacific Ocean such as the Galápagos Islands, its population 
                    has dropped sharply from around 20,000 in the 1960s to 6,400 in 2010s, according 
                    to 
                    <a href= "https://www.ace-eco.org/vol9/iss1/art6/" target="_blank">a study in Avian Conservation and Ecology</a>
                    .
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Despite ongoing global efforts to conserve nature, there are around 1,500 bird 
                    species at risk of extinction. The number has increased to an unprecedented level 
                    in recent decades, from 1,183 in 2000 to 1,492 in 2018 and 1,486 in 2019, according
                    to the assessment by 
                    <a href="https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/2021-3_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf" target="_blank">IUCN</a>
                    and

                <p>
                    The slight decline from its record high in 2018 does not necessarily mean recovery. 
                    Although comprehensive data covering both species at risk and species vanished are 
                    not currently available, the IUCN Red List says the number of species that are 
                    considered as extinct has also increased from 150 in 2018 to 164 in 2021.

                    Last year, 
                    <a href = "https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2021-09/us-fish-and-wildlife-service-proposes-delisting-23-species-endangered-species" target="_blank">the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last year declared 23 species, including 11 birds such as the ivory-billed woodpecker and Bachman’s warbler, as extinct</a>
                    . Almost 3 billion birds have been lost in North America since 1970 and these 
                    extinctions highlight the need to take action to prevent further losses, 
                    the federal agency says in the statement.

                    “Birds serve us by performing important jobs in the world that benefit us,” said

                    blog. Birds act as pollinators and seed dispersers for many plants valuable to us, 
                    such as trees that produce building material, fruit and other foods, and medicine, 
                    he said, playing “integral roles in their ecosystems."

                    Several regions known as major hotspots of bird diversity are also at risk.

                    Primary drivers of biodiversity loss are caused by human activities. 
                    Agriculture threatens 1,120 species, as much as 20 % of total species at risk, 
                    by being a major source of habitat loss and fragmentation. Deforestation by logging 
                    and gathering terrestrial plants account for the decline of 825 species, 15% of total 
                    threatened, and overexploitation by hunting and trapping drive 790 species, 14%, at risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Climate change has devastating impacts on survival of vulnerable species. Currently 509 
                    species are at risk due to climate change and 293 more due to wildfires. The situation could 
                    be even severer in the next decades as the number of wildfires is projected to increase by 
                    50% by 2100,  according to 
                    <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/number-wildfires-rise-50-2100-and-governments-are-not-prepared" target="_blank">a research by UN Environment Programme (UNEP)</a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    While efforts to halt climate change and biodiversity loss are being made worldwide, 
                    ornithologists, environmental scientists, and natural conservation experts call for 
                    rapid acceleration of actions and investments. According to an  
                    <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/01/1110732" target="_blank">estimate</a>
                    by UNEP, G20 countries need to play more roles by increasing their investment 
                    on natural conservation to $285 billion by 2050, which means 140% jump from $120 
                    billion in 2020, in order to meet biodiversity, land restoration and climate targets
                    that they have agreed upon.

                    “Bird survival is human survival and birds are telling us they are in trouble,” 
                    said David Yarnold, the former CEO of Audubon Society, in a post on 
                    <a href=https://twitter.com/david_yarnold target=”_blank”>Twitter</a>
                    . As birds and wildlife are disappearing at an alarming rate, he said, "we have no time to lose."
